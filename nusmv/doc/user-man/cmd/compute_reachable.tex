\begin{nusmvCommand}{compute\_reachable} {Computes the set of reachable states}

\cmdLine{compute\_reachable [-h]}

Computes the set of reachable states. The result is then used to
simplify image and preimage computations. This can result in improved
performances for models with sparse state spaces. Sometimes this
option may slow down the performances because the computation of
reachable states may be very expensive. The environment variable
\envvar{forward\_search} is set during the execution of this
command. Since version 2.4.0, the computation of the reachable states
is automatically performed as the variable \envvar{forward\_search} is
set by default.
